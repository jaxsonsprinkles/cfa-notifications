# Chick-Fil-A Leadership Club Email Notification System

I'm part of the Chick-Fil-A Leadership Club, and one issue that we have is that some people don't show up to the meetings. I hypothesized that this was because the notification emails were getting lost in the dozens of other emails that us students get. To solve this problem, I created an automated email reminder system that alerts members one week, three days, the day before, and the morning of the meeting. This improves meeting engagement and attendance.

What I built:

- Automated email reminder system
- Member management
- Event scheduling
- Cron automation
- Professional email templates

Built in 6 days (Nov 18-24)
